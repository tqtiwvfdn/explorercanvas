## Contributor License Agreements ##

Before we can accept a patch from you, you must sign a Contributor License
Agreement (CLA). The CLA protects you and us.

  * If you are an individual writing original source code that you wish to contribute to ExplorerCanvas and you are sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work to ExplorerCavnvas, then you will need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it.
